# BIOPHOTONICS
Material for the computer laboratory of the course "Biophotonics" held in the Physics Engineering course @ Politecnico di Milano, Italy.
The laboratory requires a working installation of MATLAB and a basics knowledge on how to manage vectors, matrixes and data plot.

## Tentative program
### Lesson 1: Monte Carlo
Introduction to Monte Carlo methods.
Application to the photon transport in biological tissues.

### Lesson 2: Time-domain Diffusion Approximation (TD-DA)
The Green function of the diffusion equation inside an infinite homogeneous medium.
Discussion about the dependence on the optical properties and source-detector distance.

### Lesson 3: Boundary conditions
Discussion on the boundary conditions under the diffusion approximation.
Implementation of the green function for a semi-infinite, homogeneous slab.
Comparison with MC simulations.

### Lesson 4: Inverse problem - data fitting
Data fit/regression of the asymptotic slope of the time-domain solution of the TD-DA.
Data fit of the whole curve to simulated MC noisy data.

### Lesson 5: Inverse problem - tomography
Introduction to ill-posed problems and regularization.
Application to Diffuse Optical Tomography.
